# MPHrandomizer
This is my attemp at making a randomizer for Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo ds.

Grab a fresh copy from the releases on the right!

# Things to note

Important!! Theres a bug in logic right now that causes unbeatable seeds, if the game gives you magmaul and expects you to go through the magmaul door in sic transit without giving you judicator you'll be softlocked because there's a forcefield infront of the door that only disappears when slench v2 is defeated but it is impossible to get to slench v2 without the judicator. This has been fixed and an update will be posted here either on 29/9/22 or 30/9/22 after testing. Sorry about that!

1. This is still very early in development so there's gonna be bugs
2. The program will crash if you click randomize and then without closing the window click randomize again
3. Don't put letters in the Seed entry box, it will crash
4. It is in logic right now to do bomb jumps in the incubation vaults so your first beam can be placed in incubation vault 02 or 03
5. I will eventually make the randomizer unpack and repack the rom on it's own
6. If loading up the rom on twilight menu on the 3ds and a red screen shows up repack the rom with dslazy (idk why but sometimes the 3ds doesn't like the rom)

# How to use

You will need a program that can unpack and repack nds roms
I personally use **[dslazy](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/793/)**
 1. unpack a fresh MetroidPrimeHunters rev1 USA rom using dslazy. (I'm not sure if the addresses for the entity files are the same for the other versions of the game so just stick with this version)
 2. open up MPHrando and click select entities folder, then open up the folder with dslazy in it and navigate to \dslazy\NDS_UNPACK\data\levels this is where the entities folder will be located, select it.
 3. press randomize.
 4. open up dslazy again if you closed it and click ndspacker.
 And thats it!
 
 if you're still having trouble figuring it out I made a **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4i4qoCch90)** that shows visually how to do it.
