# MPHrandomizer
This is my attempt at making a randomizer for Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo DS.

Grab a fresh copy from the releases on the right!

# Things to note

1. This is still very early in development, so there will be bugs.
2. The program will crash if you click randomize and then without closing the window click randomize again
3. Don't put non-number characters in the Seed entry box, that currently causes a crash.
4. It is in logic right now to do bomb jumps in the incubation vaults so your second beam after volt driver could be placed in incubation vault 02 or 03
5. I will eventually make the randomizer unpack and repack the rom on it's own
7. If you boot to a red screen when using TwilightMenu on 3DS, repack the rom and try again.  I don't know why the 3DS doesn't like the rom sometimes.

# How to use

You will need a program that can unpack and repack nds roms.
I personally use **[dslazy](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/793/)**
 1. Unpack a Metroid Prime Hunters Rev1 USA rom using dslazy. (I'm not sure if the addresses for the entity files are the same for the other versions of the game, so just stick with Rev1)
 2. Open up MPHrando and click "Select your entities folder", then browse to your unpacked rom. Select the "entities" folder in data\levels.
 3. Enter a seed value.
 4. Press randomize.
 5. Repack your MPH rom.
 And thats it!

 Special thanks to NoneGiven and unknown for their work on **[MPHread](https://github.com/NoneGiven/MphRead)** without that I wouldn't have been able to figure out how to change items
